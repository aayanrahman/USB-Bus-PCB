Introduction
This project involves the design and implementation of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) USB bus with multiple USB ports stemming from a single USB connection. The objective is to create a functional and reliable USB hub that can expand a single USB port into several, providing connectivity for multiple USB devices.

Features
Multiple USB Ports: Expand a single USB port into multiple ports.
Compact Design: Small and efficient PCB layout.
Plug-and-Play: Easy to use with no additional drivers required for most operating systems.
Power Management: Efficient power distribution to connected devices.

Hardware Requirements
PCB designed for USB bus.
USB hub IC (Integrated Circuit).
USB connectors (Type-A).
Power management components (capacitors, diodes, etc.).
Soldering equipment.
Enclosure for the PCB (optional).

Software Requirements
PCB design software (e.g., KiCad, Eagle, Altium Designer) for viewing and editing design files.
Firmware (if applicable) for USB hub IC.
Installation and Setup
Download Design Files: Obtain the PCB design files from the Design Files section.
PCB Fabrication: Send the design files to a PCB manufacturer.
Component Sourcing: Acquire the required components as listed in the Bill of Materials (BOM).
Assembly: Solder the components onto the PCB following the provided schematic and layout.
Power Connection: Connect the power supply if an external power source is used.
Testing: Verify the connections and functionality before usage.

Usage Instructions
Connect to Host: Plug the single USB input port into your computer or host device.
Connect Devices: Plug your USB devices into the available ports on the PCB.
Power On: Ensure the PCB is powered if using an external power source.
Operation: The connected devices should be recognized by the host device and function as expected.

Testing and Validation
Functional Testing: Connect various USB devices and ensure they are recognized and operational.
Power Testing: Verify that the power distribution is stable and within specifications.
Performance Testing: Check data transfer rates to ensure they meet USB standards.

Troubleshooting
No Power: Check all power connections and ensure the power supply is functioning.
Device Not Recognized: Verify the solder joints and connections for any faults.
Intermittent Connectivity: Inspect for any loose connections or potential short circuits.
Future Improvements
Enhanced Power Management: Implement advanced power regulation for higher power devices.
Additional Ports: Expand the design to include more USB ports.
Integrated Enclosure: Design a custom enclosure to protect the PCB and components.
